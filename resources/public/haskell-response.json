        "description": "<p>Software Developer </p>\n\n<p>Jane Street is a proprietary quantitative trading firm, focusing primarily on trading equities and equity derivatives. We use innovative technology, a scientific approach, and a deep understanding of markets to stay successful in our highly competitive field. We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<p>The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don't come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We've got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world's largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you're interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there's no better place.</p>\n\n<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there's a lot of room for growth.</p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (<a href=\"http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61\">http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61</a>), and our programming blog (<a href=\"http://ocaml.janestreet.com\">http://ocaml.janestreet.com</a>).</p>\n\n<p>We also have extensive benefits, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>90% book reimbursement for work-related books</li>\n<li>90% tuition reimbursement for continuing education</li>\n<li>Excellent, zero-premium medical and dental insurance</li>\n<li>Free lunch delivered daily from a selection of restaurants</li>\n<li>Catered breakfasts and fresh brewed Peet's coffee</li>\n<li>An on-site, private gym in New York with towel service</li>\n<li>Kitchens fully stocked with a variety of snack choices</li>\n<li>Full company 401(k) match up to 6% of salary, vests immediately</li>\n</ul><p>More information at <a href=\"http://janestreet.com/culture/benefits/\">http://janestreet.com/culture/benefits/</a></p>",
